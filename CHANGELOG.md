## 0.3.0

* Automatically create a canvas if not given one.
* Allow creating a `UserInterface` without an initial terminal.
* Add an example app.

## 0.2.1

* Fix bad assert in `Screen._bind()`.

  exposes raw key down events as they happen and also allows user-defined
  key bindings.

  handled.

* Remove (useless) `write()` method.

* Handle semicolon keyCode difference between Firefox (59) and Chrome (186).
